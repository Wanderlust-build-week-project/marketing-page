# Wanderlust

The marketing landing page for the build week project "Wanderlust".

[Wanderlust Landing Page](https://epic-minsky-812a3d.netlify.com/index.html)

## Main Page

The main landing page consists of a simple header with a nav, title, title subtext, and call to action button nested inside. After that there is a section for reviews, a marketing description of Wanderlust, more marketing to tour guides at the bottom ('Your Tour, Your Way'), and a footer.

## About page

The about page consists of a header with a nav, title, and background image. An 'Our Team' section describing the team, a section for portfolio cards of the team members that contain an image, name, role, and github link. And finally a footer. 

## LESS

This web page integrates LESS as a preprocessor with many files for different sections of the page. All files are then imported into ```index.less``` for the landing page and ```about-page.less``` for the about page.

#### Less Mixins
We create mixins in the ```mixins.less``` file. For example, making a mixin for the background header images on both the about page and home page.

#### Less Variables.
Our variables are stored in the ```variables.less``` file. You'll find color variables to our gray border variable that we use for both the main landing page and for the cards on the about page.
